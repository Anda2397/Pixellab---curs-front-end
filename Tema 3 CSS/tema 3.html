            <div class="about-text">Corgis have a long, long history as herding dogs.
                In fact, they were used as herders as early as the 10th century. <br /> <br />
                But why Corgis? Their small stature gave them a huge advantage in the
                cattle-herding game. Not only did their shortness give them easy access
                to cows' lower legs and ankles — they'd nip at cattle to send them in the
                right directions — but it protected them from the cow's retaliatory kicks, too.
                Plus, Corgis are known to be incredibly athletic and quick dogs. <br /> <br />  
                Although there may not be as many herding Corgis today, many compete inherding
                competitions — some of which are actually hosted by the American Kennel Club.
